# My index project

Hello, my name is Kau√£ Alves Santos, I am from Brazil and I have done this simple project to make my life easily when creating index of directories. The software creates in our console a simple md table that can be pasted in you md file. I hope this project can be usefully to you and our daily progress.

## How to use

Is pretty simple, you can just opem the startPrpogram.bat file and follow the structions. If you prefer, you can run the program in a different terminal just by running **npm run start** in the project directory.
